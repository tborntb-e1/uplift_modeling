# Uplift Modeling with Meta-Learners: Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects


This project aims to estimate the **Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)** to evaluate the impact of an email marketing campaign on customer spending. Unlike traditional methods that estimate an overall average treatment effect, this approach leverages **uplift modeling** to uncover how different customer segments respond to the campaign, enabling more personalized marketing strategies. By utilizing **meta-learners** (including T-Learner, S-Learner, and X-Learner), I capture heterogeneous effects and compare their performance using robust evaluation metrics.

You can read more about each meta-learner approach in my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@LillyH/part-2-1-conditional-treatment-heterogenous-effect-estimation-cate-w-7a25916bc6e7).
